        ## Death Stranding
        This is a game like no other... Not only is its "delivery guy simulator"-like play style unique, but it also 
        gives me the feeling of **connection with other players**, which is usually not the case for single-player or
        even multi-player games. The amazing soundtrack and breath-taking scenery are the icing on the cake.

        ## Outer Wilds
        As a fan of sci-fi, I am in love with this game! At first, the player is just some random astronaut ready to
        explore the universe. But as we play, we gradually uncover the long history and secrets of a former civilization, learn the
        great laws of nature, and... Well, I can't say more. This is a must-play that is best experienced by finishing
        the game solely by yourself, without looking at other players' comments or tips.

        ## The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt
        One of the best open-world games in my mind. It tells a long story, but the path to find Ciri never gets boring. 
        Each character you encounter has so different personalities that this world of witchers, sorcerers, dwarfs and monsters
        is extremely immersive and realistic. The **two DLCs are incredible**, some of the best DLCs I have ever tried.
        *Gwent* also adds a lot of fun to the game.

        ## God of War
        It is awarded *Game Of The Year* for a reason. It depicts a stunning world based on Norse mythology, and tells
        a beautiful yet thought-provoking story of a father and a son. The gameplay is amazing, with the seamless combat scenes
        and cool visual effects, it makes the journey to Jötunheim an unforgettable adventure.

        ## Red Dead Redemption 2
        It is the most realistic open-world game I have ever played. The scenery, the physics, the particles,
        everything is just perfect. The open-world is fine-tuned to the tiniest details that it really let you forget about
        reality. With the great acting and a beutiful story about redemption, Arthur Morgan is probably one of the most 
        beloved protagonists in all games.

        ## 上海彩虹室内合唱团
        The *Rainbow Chamber Singers* have produced some of my faviourite songs. Thanks to Mr. Jin Chengzhi, the songs can tell great
        stories. [感觉身体被掏空](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFaQwZyPOZQ) and [春节自救指南](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvdXowqlv5U)
        make the audience laugh easily, while songs like [星河旅馆](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjQUyz7XMno) and [道别是一件难事](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CXkXt2yj-A)
        are touching and thought-provoking. The artists have a great passion towards their music, as I can feel by listening to their concerts.

        ## Wiener Philharmoniker
        The classic music played by *Vienna Philharmonic* is one of the best in the world. I have been recently addicted to 
        the [Neujahrskonzert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCw77XrAFGQ) for each year, where cheerful musics
        are beautifully played, giving people all over the world new hope for a better new year and a brighter future.
        
        *Prosit Neujahr!*

        ## Low Roar
        Though I learned about this band through the game *Death Stranding*, I quickly became one of their fans. Their music have amazing power.
        Being calming and soothing, they make me feel relaxed on my way to school or back home after a day of busy works. Some of my favourites
        are [Once In A Long, Long While](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv3rKRoRtd4), [I'll Keep Coming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnrGMHhnqrw),
        [Gosia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd_lUKJ_amM), and [Don't Be so Serious](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D56XxiS_pJ0).

        Rest in peace, Ryan Karazija. I will always remember and appreciate your music.
